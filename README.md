# Esri Leaflet RequireJS Example

Example of using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) and [Esri Leaflet](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/) with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)!

1. [Fork and clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. `cd` into `esri-leaflet-browserify-example`
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Using r.js

This example includes a configuration file `build-config.js` that also sets up Leaflet and Esri Leaflet with the [RequireJS Optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html). You can run the optimizer with:

```bash
node node_modules/.bin/r.js -o build-config.js
```

or

```bash
npm run build
```
